As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there’s nuthin' left
'Cuz I’ve been blasting and laughing so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone...

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talking, and where you're walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc.
